<h2>I recieve a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penney's worth.</h2>
  <p class="sub">" I was an EMI for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and I found it incredibly fun I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best- and most grundling - time of my life. Since completing the course. I've successfully swithched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

      <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended !</h2>
       <p class="section2">" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a formal student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interview as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multitude offers. 100% recommend! " </p>
